/*
The `usePresence` hook is designed for real-time presence tracking in collaborative applications. It allows a user to join a room, update their presence data, and periodically send pulse signals to indicate they are active.

Key Features:
- Maintains presence data: Manages user data such as current activity or status within a specific room.
- Pulse mechanism: Regularly updates the user's 'last seen' timestamp to reflect real-time activity.
- Filters out self-presence: Excludes the current user's data from the presence list to focus on other users in the room.

Working Mechanism:
- Upon initialization, the hook updates the user's presence in the specified room with initial data.
- It sets up an interval based on `pulsePeriod` (defaulting to 10 seconds) to continuously signal the user's active presence.
- A callback function, `updateData`, allows for updating the user's presence data, which is then reflected across the application.
- The hook determines if a user is considered 'online' based on their last update timestamp, using an 'old' threshold of 18 seconds.


Known Issues:
- Online status needs to be debugged
- The hook does not have a way to clear presence data
